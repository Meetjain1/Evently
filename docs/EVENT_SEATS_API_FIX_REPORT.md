# Event Seats API Fix - Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation and fixes made to the Event Seats API endpoint `/api/events/:eventId/seats`. The endpoint was previously returning 404 errors and not functioning correctly.

## Problem Diagnosis

1. **Initial Issue**: The endpoint `/api/events/:eventId/seats` was defined in the Swagger documentation but not properly implemented in the codebase.
2. **Investigation**: Logs showed that when trying to access this endpoint, the application was unable to find the specified event, resulting in 404 errors.
3. **Root Cause**: The routing configuration was not correctly connecting the event route to the seat controller method.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a multi-faceted solution to ensure the endpoint works reliably:

### 1. Direct Route Implementation

We created a standalone route file that bypasses the standard routing system:

```typescript
// src/routes/direct-event-seats.routes.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { SeatService } from '../services/seat.service';
import { EventService } from '../services/event.service';
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import { getPaginationParams, getSortingParams } from '../utils/helpers';
import { SeatStatus } from '../models';

const router = Router();
const seatService = new SeatService();
const eventService = new EventService();

// Direct endpoint for getting seats by event
router.get('/api/events/:eventId/seats', async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    console.log('Direct route: Getting seats for event ID:', req.params.eventId);
    const { page, limit } = getPaginationParams(req);
    const { sort, order } = getSortingParams(req, 'rowName', 'ASC');
    const status = req.query.status as string;
    
    // Get the event to find its venueId
    const event = await eventService.getEventById(req.params.eventId);
    
    console.log('Direct route: Event found:', event ? 'yes' : 'no');
    if (!event) {
      console.log('Direct route: Event not found, returning 404');
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Not Found - The requested resource does not exist' });
    }
    
    console.log('Direct route: Event venue ID:', event.venueId);
    
    // Now get seats for the venue, filtered by this event if seats are assigned to events
    const result = await seatService.getSeats({
      venueId: event.venueId,
      eventId: req.params.eventId,
      status: status ? status as SeatStatus : undefined,
      sort,
      order,
      page,
      limit,
    });
    
    res.status(200).json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in direct event seats route:', error);
    next(error);
  }
});

export default router;
```

### 2. Controller Method Implementation

We also ensured the standard controller method was properly implemented:

```typescript
// In SeatController
getSeatsForEvent = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    console.log('Getting seats for event ID:', req.params.eventId);
    const { page, limit } = getPaginationParams(req);
    const { sort, order } = getSortingParams(req, 'rowName', 'ASC');
    const status = req.query.status as string;
    
    // Get the event to find its venueId
    const event = await this.seatService.getEventById(req.params.eventId);
    console.log('Event found:', event ? 'yes' : 'no');
    if (!event) {
      console.log('Event not found, returning 404');
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Not Found - The requested resource does not exist' });
    }
    console.log('Event venue ID:', event.venueId);
    
    // Now get seats for the venue, filtered by this event if seats are assigned to events
    const result = await this.seatService.getSeats({
      venueId: event.venueId,
      eventId: req.params.eventId,
      status: status ? status as SeatStatus : undefined,
      sort,
      order,
      page,
      limit,
    });
    
    res.status(200).json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
```

### 3. Main Router Connection

We updated the main routes index file to include our direct route:

```typescript
// In src/routes/index.ts
import directEventSeatsRoute from './direct-event-seats.routes';

// Other import statements...

const router = Router();

// API routes
router.use('/auth', authRoutes);
router.use('/events', eventRoutes);
// Other route registrations...

// Direct routes (workarounds)
router.use('/', directEventSeatsRoute);

export default router;
```

## Testing and Validation

We tested the implementation with the following event ID and verified it works correctly:

```
GET /api/events/a9eb6c28-913e-11f0-a14a-fc1d9bb2aa3c/seats?status=available&page=1&limit=50
```

The logs show:
1. The event is successfully found
2. The venue ID is correctly retrieved
3. Seats are successfully fetched from the database
4. The response returns with a 200 status code

## Documentation

We updated the API documentation to reflect these changes:

1. Updated the API Testing Guide to indicate the endpoint is now working
2. Created a comprehensive Seat Creation Guide explaining how to create seats in both single and bulk formats
3. Created detailed API documentation for all seat-related endpoints

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Remove Debugging Logs**: Once the system has been running stably, remove the console.log statements to improve performance.
2. **Consolidate Route Implementations**: Consider merging the direct route implementation back into the main routing system once confident in its stability.
3. **Implement Cache**: For frequently accessed events and their seats, implement caching to improve performance.
4. **Add Unit Tests**: Create unit tests specifically for the event seats endpoint to prevent regressions.

## Conclusion

The Event Seats API endpoint is now fully functional and working as expected. Users can now successfully retrieve seats for specific events, with options to filter by status and use pagination.
